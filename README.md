WEEK 1

In the Week1 of DataMining Class I familiarized myself with the Python Notebook, basic pandas functions.

The Dataset I used for this particular assignment is "DataAnalyst.csv" I have attached a copy of the dataset which I have used along with the python code in this folder. What was done in the Jupyter notebook??

Let me breif so that it becomes easy to explore.....

I have loaded the dataset initially
Checked the shape of the dataset(i.e number of rows and columns)
Took a peak of the dataset by displaying the top 5 rows in the dataset
Later created a barplot of Top 5 industries by Job Count (Excluding '-1')
Cleaned the dataset and mentioned the cleaning process performed in the notebook with comments which are easy to understand
Created a bar plot of mean salary estimate from the same top 5 industries.
--> Now comes the interesting part is my curiorisity on the dataset made me to raise a question which is I was curious about how the type of ownerships is impacting the industries, so what I did is I took the total count of various type of ownerships and after that I have removed the Unknown or missing values in the dataset.

--> Later I got a count of various type of ownerships among these ownerships I took the top 3 most frequent ownerships and created a bar plot of the top 3 ownerships with the top 5 industries that I have analyzed
